                  <p>
                  Water towers are, of course, for storing and supplying water for use. Usually for potable water for use in homes and businesses, they can also be made for supplying non-potable water for firefighting or any need that arises.

                  Water towers function by using hydrostaic pressure to move water through underground supply pipes. Water is pumped up into the tower from a treatment plant.
                  The pressure is generated by gravity, each foot the water is above supply is .43 psi.
                  The reason water towers are in such wide use is their ability to supply higher pressure than the pump is rated. The tower can drain during high demand times without losing pressure, creating a buffer for the supply pump.
                  Without the tower, a pump large enough to handle the highest demand level would need to be used, instead of a much smaller one to keep the water tower full.

            Water tower sizes can vary depending on the need, from thousands of gallons to over three million such as this mushroom shaped tower from finland. Water towers can stay functional for over a hundred years, making them far more future proof than using a large scale pump.
            An additional advantage that came with the adoption of water towers was the ability to keep the supply water clean, saving communities from cholera outbreaks caused by personal wells.
            They are also often used as bases to mount communications equipment on, as well as landmarks; and in some cases, decoration.
